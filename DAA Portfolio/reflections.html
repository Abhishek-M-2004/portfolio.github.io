    <h2>Topics Learnt</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>1. Time Complexity:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>I now understand the crucial role of asymptotic analysis (Big O, Big Omega, Big Theta) in evaluating algorithm efficiency. It helps us in understanding how an algorithm’s time complexity varies as a function of the input size.</li>
                <li>I have become proficient in identifying the growth rates of common algorithms and data structures, such as linear search, binary search, sorting algorithms (bubble sort, insertion sort, merge sort, quick sort), tree traversals, and graph algorithms.</li>
                <li>I now recognize how the choice of data structure significantly influences an algorithm's time complexity. For example, using a hash table for lookups provides constant time complexity, whereas searching an unsorted array requires linear time.</li>
                <li>I've learned to apply time complexity analysis to real-world scenarios. I can now evaluate the performance of different algorithms and choose the most appropriate one for a given problem and dataset size.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

                        <li>The left subtree of any node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.</li>
                        <li>The right subtree of any node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>I've learned to implement and analyze the time complexity of key BST operations, including:

                        <li>Deletion: Removing nodes from the tree while preserving the BST structure, considering various cases (nodes with no children, one child, or two children).</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>I've studied different tree traversal methods (In-order, Pre-order, Post-order) and their applications. In-order traversal of a BST results in a sorted list of the keys.</li>
                <li>I've explored variations of BSTs, such as:
                    <ul>
                        <li>AVL Trees: Self-balancing BSTs that maintain a balanced height to ensure efficient search and insertion operations.</li>
                        <li>Red-Black Trees: Another type of self-balancing BST with stricter balance constraints, providing guaranteed logarithmic time complexity for all operations.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>

                        <li>I can implement DFS using recursion or an iterative approach (using a stack).</li>
                        <li>I recognize the applications of DFS, such as:

                        <li>I can implement BFS using a queue.</li>
                        <li>I am aware of the applications of BFS, including:
                            <ul>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Heap Properties:</strong> I have understood the heap properties:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Max-Heap: In a max-heap, the parent node is always greater than or equal to its children.</li>
                        <li>Min-Heap: In a min-heap, the parent node is always less than or equal to its children.</li>

            </ul>
        </li>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Brute Force:</strong> I've learned the basic concept of Brute Force string matching, which involves iterating through the text character by character and comparing it with the pattern. While simple, it can be inefficient for longer patterns.</li>
                <li><strong>Boyer-Moore Algorithm:</strong> I've studied the Boyer-Moore algorithm, a more efficient algorithm that utilizes two heuristics:

This allows for linear-time pattern searching in the worst case.</li>
                <li><strong>Rabin-Karp Algorithm:</strong> I've been introduced to the Rabin-Karp algorithm, which uses hashing to compare the hash values of the pattern and substrings in the text. This can be more efficient than comparison-based algorithms for certain cases.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Prim’s Algorithm: A greedy algorithm that builds the MST one edge at a time, selecting the edge with the smallest weight that connects a node in the MST to a node outside the MST.</li>
                        <li>Kruskal’s Algorithm: A greedy algorithm that sorts all edges and adds them one by one to the MST, ensuring that no cycles are formed.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
