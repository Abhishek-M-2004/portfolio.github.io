  <h4>Problem Types in Nature:</h4>
  <p>Throughout the course, I realized that many real-world problems can be solved using basic techniques like iteration, recursion, and backtracking. These techniques help break down complex problems into simpler steps, allowing for efficient solutions.</p>
  <br>
  <h4>Space and Time Efficiency:</h4>
  <p>Space and time efficiency are important because they determine how fast and how much memory an algorithm will need to solve a problem. Some problems require faster solutions, while others need to minimize memory usage. Understanding how different algorithms scale helps choose the best one for any scenario.</p>
  <br>
  <h4>Algorithm Design Principles:</h4>
  <p>Different design principles like divide and conquer, dynamic programming, and greedy algorithms help solve problems in unique ways. Some methods are more efficient in terms of time, while others minimize space usage. These principles teach us how to approach problems logically and systematically.</p>
  <br>
  <h4>Tree and Graph Algorithms:</h4>
  <p>In this course, I learned the importance of trees and graphs for organizing data in ways that allow us to efficiently access and modify it. Tree structures like BST, AVL, and red-black trees provide balanced ways to store data, while graph algorithms help in finding paths and optimizing routes.</p>
  <br>
  <h4>Sorting and Searching Algorithms:</h4>
  <p>Sorting and searching algorithms are fundamental because they help arrange data in a way that makes it easy to find what we're looking for. These techniques are widely used in everything from databases to artificial intelligence, where efficiency is key.</p>
